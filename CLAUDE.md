# CLAUDE.md - Identity Learning Projects

## Goal
Build 4 identity projects in 3 days to demonstrate rapid domain mastery for senior leadership role interview (Friday).

## Core Principles
1. **Production-quality patterns**: Error handling, observability, security, testing
2. **Document learning**: Capture "aha!" moments, explain trade-offs
3. **Multi-tenant thinking**: Design for global scale, HA requirements
4. **Security first**: Follow OWASP identity best practices

## Project Execution Order

### Priority 1: OAuth2/OIDC Server (6-8 hours)
**Stack**: Go, Redis, JWT, Docker
**Core Features**: Authorization Code Flow, PKCE, Client Credentials, Token Refresh, OIDC ID Tokens
**Security**: State parameter (CSRF), short token lifetimes (15m access, 30d refresh), scope validation

---

### Priority 2: Static Security Scanner (6-8 hours)
**Stack**: Go, Cobra CLI, YAML rules
**Scans**: Weak secrets, insecure redirect URIs, JWT issues, SAML misconfigs
**Output**: JSON/Markdown/SARIF, CI/CD integration

---

### Priority 3: Runtime Security Scanner (6-8 hours)
**Stack**: Go, HTTP client, attack simulation
**Tests**: CSRF, token replay, authorization code interception, algorithm confusion
**Output**: Attack simulation reports

---

### Priority 4: Multi-Tenant Session Management (8-10 hours)
**Stack**: Go, Redis Cluster, JWT, k6 load testing, Prometheus
**Features**: Multi-tenant isolation, stateless validation, token refresh, session revocation
**Scale**: 10K+ concurrent sessions, <10ms p99 latency

## Tech Stack
- **Go**: Fast, concurrent, single binary, strong stdlib
- **Redis**: Distributed cache, HA, TTL support
- **JWT**: Stateless validation, standard claims
- **k6**: Load testing
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Observability

## Key Libraries
- `golang-jwt/jwt`, `go-redis/redis`, `gorilla/mux`, `spf13/cobra`, `spf13/viper`

## Resources

ALWAYS link critical acroyms and industry standars within markdown files to authoritative references.

- [RFC 6749 - OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749)
- [RFC 7636 - Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636)
- [RFC 7519 - JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519)
- [OpenID Connect Core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)
- [OWASP ASVS - Identity and Authentication](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
- [NIST SP 800-63B - Digital Identity Guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html)

## Documentation Standards

**CRITICAL**: When editing markdown files (.md), ALWAYS hyperlink:
- All RFCs (RFC 6749, RFC 7636, etc.) â†’ https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfcXXXX
- All OIDC specs â†’ https://openid.net/specs/
- All technical terms (OAuth2, JWT, PKCE, SAML, etc.) â†’ authoritative sources
- All tools/libraries (Go, Redis, Docker, etc.) â†’ official homepages or GitHub repos
- All security concepts (CSRF, SPA, etc.) â†’ OWASP, Wikipedia, or relevant docs
- All local markdown docs â†’ relative paths (e.g., [PRD](docs/PRD.md))
- All source files â†’ relative paths (e.g., [jwt.go](internal/tokens/jwt.go))

This makes documentation self-navigating with one-click access to authoritative sources.

## Interview Talking Points

### Demonstrating Rapid Domain Mastery
**Project 1 (OAuth2/OIDC Server)**:
> "I built an OAuth2/OIDC authorization server from RFC specs in 8 hours. Implemented all 4 flows - Authorization Code, PKCE, Client Credentials, Token Refresh. This wasn't just copying tutorials; I read RFC 6749, RFC 7636, and OIDC Core 1.0 spec, then implemented them. Helped me internalize the trade-offs - like why PKCE is non-negotiable for mobile apps."

**Project 2 (Security Scanner)**:
> "Applied my security scanner experience from Stash Financial to the identity domain. Built a CLI tool that detects 12 OAuth2/JWT vulnerability types in < 5ms. Same pattern as my previous work: team paralyzed by 10K vulnerabilities â†’ built prioritization. Here it's: manual security reviews take hours â†’ automated in milliseconds with clear remediation."

### Innovation Through Simplification
> "The security scanner embodies this principle. Expert security reviews require deep OAuth2/OIDC knowledge and hours of analysis. My tool automates it: scan config file â†’ get findings with RFC references and fix instructions â†’ integrate into CI/CD. Shifts security left without requiring every developer to be an identity expert."

### Bias for Action
> "Didn't just read about identity protocols - built 4 projects in 3 days. Each project taught me a different layer: Project 1 = protocol implementation, Project 2 = security hardening, Project 3 = attack vectors, Project 4 = scale patterns. Learning by doing, not passive reading."

### Multi-Brand/Multi-Tenant Thinking (for Expedia)
**Project 4 (Session Management)**:
> "Designed multi-tenant session management with Expedia's challenge in mind - unified identity across multiple brands. Each tenant (brand) gets isolated signing keys, separate session pools, but shared infrastructure. Think: Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo - one platform, isolated contexts. Used Redis cluster for global scale, JWT for stateless validation."

### Technical Depth Examples
- **OAuth2 vs OIDC**: "OAuth2 is authorization - 'can user X access resource Y?' OIDC adds identity - 'who is user X?' Built both layers to understand the distinction."
- **PKCE Security**: "Prevents authorization code interception. Without it, malicious apps on mobile devices can steal codes. I documented the attack in my PKCE deep dive."
- **Token Validation Trade-offs**: "Stateless JWT = fast (no DB lookup), but can't revoke. Stateful = revocable, but needs Redis lookup. My session service uses hybrid: JWT for validation, Redis blocklist for revocation."

## Code Quality Patterns Applied

### Security First
- âœ… Zero hardcoded secrets (all via environment variables or secret references)
- âœ… Secret redaction in scanner output
- âœ… PKCE enforcement for public clients
- âœ… State parameter for CSRF protection
- âœ… Short token lifetimes (15m access, 30d refresh)

### Production Patterns
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling with context
- âœ… Structured logging (ready for observability platforms)
- âœ… Graceful shutdown and health checks
- âœ… Configuration via environment (12-factor app)
- âœ… Docker deployments with docker-compose
- âœ… Makefile for developer productivity

### Documentation Excellence
- âœ… Every project has PRD, README, CHANGELOG
- âœ… Architecture diagrams for complex systems
- âœ… Educational deep-dives (OIDC walkthrough, PKCE deep dive)
- âœ… All links to RFCs, OWASP, security standards
- âœ… Example configurations (vulnerable + secure)

### Testing & Validation
- âœ… Scanner: Tested on 16-issue vulnerable config (100% detection)
- âœ… Scanner: Tested on secure config (0 critical issues)
- âœ… OAuth2 Server: All flows tested end-to-end
- âœ… Performance: Sub-5ms scanner execution

## Key Metrics for Interview

| Project | Status | Time | Lines of Code | Key Metric |
|---------|--------|------|---------------|------------|
| Project 1: OAuth2/OIDC Server | âœ… | 8h | ~2500 | 4 flows working |
| Project 2: Security Scanner | âœ… | 8h | ~3100 | 12 detectors, <5ms |
| Project 3: Runtime Scanner | ðŸ“‹ | 6-8h | TBD | 15+ attack sims |
| Project 4: Session Mgmt | ðŸš§ | 6h+4h | ~1800 | 10K sessions |
| **Total** | **50%** | **22h/~30h** | **~7400+** | **Production-ready** |

### Security Guardrails
- **ggshield pre-commit hook**: Scans staged changes for secrets before commit
- **ggshield pre-push hook**: Scans commits before push to remote
- **`.gitignore`**: Comprehensive ignore patterns for secrets, keys, certificates
- **No hardcoded secrets**: All secrets injected via environment variables

### Adding New Secrets
1. Document in `.env.example` with placeholder value
2. Add actual value to `.env`
3. Update code to read from environment variable
4. Test with `git commit` to ensure ggshield doesn't flag it
