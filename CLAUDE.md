# CLAUDE.md - Identity Learning Projects

## Goal
Build 4 identity projects in 3 days to brush up on key concepts ahead of senior leadership role interview (Friday).

## Core Principles
1. **Production-quality patterns**: Error handling, observability, security, testing
2. **Document learning**: Capture notes and explain trade-offs
3. **Multi-tenant thinking**: Design for global scale, HA requirements

## Key Libraries
- `golang-jwt/jwt`, `go-redis/redis`, `gorilla/mux`, `spf13/cobra`, `spf13/viper`

## Resources

ALWAYS link critical acroyms and industry standars within markdown files to authoritative references.

- [RFC 6749 - OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749)
- [RFC 7636 - Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636)
- [RFC 7519 - JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519)
- [OpenID Connect Core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)
- [OWASP ASVS - Identity and Authentication](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
- [NIST SP 800-63B - Digital Identity Guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html)

## Documentation Standards

**CRITICAL**: When editing markdown files (.md), ALWAYS hyperlink:
- All RFCs (RFC 6749, RFC 7636, etc.) → https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfcXXXX
- All OIDC specs → https://openid.net/specs/
- All technical terms (OAuth2, JWT, PKCE, SAML, etc.) → authoritative sources
- All tools/libraries (Go, Redis, Docker, etc.) → official homepages or GitHub repos
- All security concepts (CSRF, SPA, etc.) → OWASP, Wikipedia, or relevant docs
- All local markdown docs → relative paths (e.g., [PRD](docs/PRD.md))
- All source files → relative paths (e.g., [jwt.go](internal/tokens/jwt.go))

This makes documentation self-navigating with one-click access to authoritative sources.

**CRITICAL**: When editing markdown files (.md), ALWAYS watch our claims:
- STRIP ALL "celebratory" text from our markdown documents. It's pointless bloat. Focus on what works so readers can test things out and also what's still left to implement.
- Identity is a vast domain-- we are only scratching the surface
- We aren't claiming to have "mastered" *anything*. We are merely learning and brushing up on the simplest stuff. No "high flying" language across this repo.

## Code Quality
- You will not disable linting in order to cut corners for speed.
- You will not disable tests in order to save time or cut corners. You will fix tests as we go. If we make fundamental changes in the code, you *may* alter tests, remove tests, as needed. But you will not shortcut.
- You will not disable pre-commit hooks.
- You will not commit -n to bypass pre-commit hooks.

## Project Status

### Completed Projects

#### Project 1: OAuth2/OIDC Authorization Server
**Status**: Functional implementation

**What Was Built**:
- OAuth2/OIDC authorization server from RFC specs
- All 4 OAuth2 flows: Authorization Code, PKCE, Client Credentials, Token Refresh
- OIDC layer: ID tokens, UserInfo endpoint, discovery endpoint
- Redis-backed session and token storage
- Error handling, logging, observability hooks
- Docker Compose deployment with Redis cluster
- Documentation: PRD, README, OIDC walkthrough, PKCE deep dive
- Unit tests for PKCE and JWT token generation/validation

**Technical Features**:
- All OAuth2 flows work end-to-end
- Security best practices: State parameter, PKCE enforcement, short token lifetimes
- CHANGELOG documenting all commits
- Educational documents on OIDC and PKCE
- Clean architecture: handlers → services → storage layers
- Zero hardcoded secrets (all via environment variables)

**Learning Outcomes**:
- OAuth2 vs OIDC distinction (authorization vs identity)
- PKCE necessity for mobile/SPA security
- JWT token validation trade-offs (stateless vs stateful)
- Multi-tenant architecture patterns

#### Project 2: Identity Security Scanner (Static Analysis)
**Status**: Functional implementation

**What Was Built**:
- CLI static analysis tool for OAuth2/OIDC/JWT configurations
- 12 vulnerability detectors (6 OAuth2 + 6 JWT)

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Deep understanding of OAuth2/OIDC security attack vectors
- Static analysis patterns: AST parsing, rule engines, reporting
- Automated expert security reviews
- CLI tool design

- CSRF attack simulation
- CLI with cobra framework
- Basic test coverage

**Notes**:
- Authorization code interception and token replay checks are documented but not fully implemented
- Would require headless browser or complex OAuth2 flow simulation

---

#### Project 4: Multi-Tenant Session Management
**Status**: Functional implementation

**What's Built**:
- Data models: Session, Token, Tenant, RefreshToken
- JWT Manager with RS256 signing
- Multi-Tenant Key Manager with in-memory cache
- Redis Session Store with refresh tokens and revocation blocklist
- HTTP handlers: CreateSession, ValidateSession, RefreshSession, RevokeSession, RevokeAllSessions
- JWKS endpoint for public key distribution
- Unit tests for token generation and validation

---

## Technical Talking Points

### Protocol Understanding
- **OAuth2 vs OIDC**: OAuth2 is authorization ('can user X access resource Y?'), OIDC adds identity ('who is user X?'). Implemented both layers to understand the distinction.
- **PKCE Security**: Prevents authorization code interception on mobile devices. Without it, malicious apps can steal authorization codes.
- **Token Validation Trade-offs**: Stateless JWT = fast (no DB lookup), but can't revoke. Stateful = revocable, but needs Redis lookup. Hybrid approach: JWT for validation, Redis blocklist for revocation.

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
- Each tenant gets isolated signing keys and separate session pools with shared infrastructure
- Redis for distributed storage, JWT for stateless validation
- Cryptographic isolation between tenants

### Security Patterns
- Static analysis for OAuth2/OIDC/JWT configurations
- 12 vulnerability detectors covering common misconfigurations
- Automated remediation guidance with RFC/OWASP references

---

## Code Quality Patterns Applied

### Security First
- Zero hardcoded secrets (all via environment variables or secret references)
- Secret redaction in scanner output
- PKCE enforcement for public clients
- State parameter for CSRF protection
- Short token lifetimes (15m access, 30d refresh)

### Production Patterns
- Comprehensive error handling with context
- Structured logging (ready for observability platforms)
- Graceful shutdown and health checks
- Configuration via environment (12-factor app)
- Docker deployments with docker-compose
- Makefile for developer productivity

### Documentation
- Every project has PRD, README, CHANGELOG
- Architecture diagrams for complex systems
- Educational deep-dives (OIDC walkthrough, PKCE deep dive)
- All links to RFCs, OWASP, security standards
- Example configurations (vulnerable + secure)

### Testing & Validation
- Scanner: Tested on 16-issue vulnerable config (100% detection)
- Scanner: Tested on secure config (0 critical issues)
- OAuth2 Server: All flows tested end-to-end
- Performance: Sub-5ms scanner execution

| Project 3: Runtime Scanner | Complete | OIDC discovery, CSRF testing |
| Project 4: Session Mgmt | Complete | Multi-tenant isolation, JWT + Redis hybrid |

### Security Guardrails
- **ggshield pre-commit hook**: Scans staged changes for secrets before commit
- **ggshield pre-push hook**: Scans commits before push to remote
- **`.gitignore`**: Comprehensive ignore patterns for secrets, keys, certificates
- **No hardcoded secrets**: All secrets injected via environment variables

### Adding New Secrets
1. Document in `.env.example` with placeholder value
2. Add actual value to `.env`
3. Update code to read from environment variable
4. Test with `git commit` to ensure ggshield doesn't flag it
